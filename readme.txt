Creates a menu dropdown for shortcode in the editor to be used in conjunction with Kyle Getsons Shortcode Generator

== Description ==

I found Kyle Getsons shortcode generator (http://getson.info/shortcode-generator/) plugin for WordPress
and thought it was so simple and exactly what I needed, but I found myself bouncing back and forth to remember
the shortcodes... so I searched on the interweb and found Kevin Chard's snippet at 
http://wpsnipp.com/index.php/functions-php/update-automatically-create-media_buttons-for-shortcode-selection/ 
to incorporate a shortcode dropdown into the editor.  I modified Kevin's code to work with Kyles and made it 
a plug-in.

Features:

* Displays all active shortcodes in a dropdown menu format.

1. Upload the `shortcode-dropdown-menu` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the shortcode drop down in the editor.
